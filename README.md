# PINNs-Development
Developing PINNs for Heat Transfer and Drag Coefficients for Given Objects

Currently using [nvidia-modulus](https://github.com/NVIDIA/modulus/tree/main) for the development of basic PINNs for Heat Transfer across a plate.
Further work will include using modulus from NVIDIA for developing models for drag calculations across given objects.
