## Lid Driven Cavity (LDC)
A lid-driven cavity is a classic fluid dynamics problem used to study flow patterns in a square or rectangular box where one of the walls (typically the top wall) moves at a constant velocity, driving the fluid inside the cavity. The remaining walls of the cavity are stationary and typically no-slip boundary conditions are applied, meaning the fluid velocity at these walls is zero. This setup creates complex internal circulating flows as the motion of the top wall induces shear in the fluid. The lid-driven cavity problem is widely used in computational fluid dynamics to validate numerical methods and study viscous flow behavior in enclosed spaces.  

Unlike 2D plate which had heat propagation through all 4 surfaces, in LDC we only have fluid movement through one surface only which is usually the upper surface. Therefore, the physics equation for this problem is slightly different as shown in below figure:
